# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project, i used Typescript, React, Mongodb, ESlint and Express Session Cookies instead of JWT tokens

In this project, you can Register, Login, Delete Note, Update Note and Create Note.

And All the notes are protected by auth middleware. You can't see other users' notes and manipulate them.

All the routes are protected. Also, users' session is expired in 1 hour. After 1 hour, you have to login again.

In addition, i used many error handling methods for almost all of the errors. Also, the errors that occur in the backend are designed to reflect

and inform the user on the client side.

In the client part, react-bootstrap library is used.

And Finally, for forms i used react form hook instead of formik and yup
